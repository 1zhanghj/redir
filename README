Redir v.1.0

This version, titled 1.0, is a current running/stable version of redir which 
is fundamentally identical to version 0.7, with the exception that it adds 
--bind-addr, which can force it to bind to a specific address or interface.
But, all things considered, it might as well be 1.0, as it's stable and done
with.  The rest of this file is still valid, may as well read the rest of the
readmes.

I'm thinking of doing a 2.0 which never forks, but does one
big-honking-select-loop, which probably wouldn't be much of a bother,
and would save a good chunk of ram, but then an FD limit becomes quite
a real possibility.  perhaps an #ifdef selecting the old or new code
would help this...  though, really, this is a known problem with a lot
of proxies, and it doesn't seem to hurt too bad.  depends on the
MAX_FDS (or whatever that define is.  FD_MAX?) on your machine.

Wow.  The authorship/maintnence for this thing has REALLY gotten mangled.  
Credits should, logically, go to the following people:

Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@ThePLAnet.net>
	For taking the code I wrote and making it into a more stable 
	sensible, and usable package.  
Sam Creasey <sammy@users.qual.net>
	Original author, but this package would be vastly inferior without 
	Nigel's modifications.
Thomas Osterried <thomas@x-berg.in-berlin.de>
	Added the --bind-addr patch.

Redir v.0.7

redir is a tcp port redirector for unix.
It can run under inetd or stand alone (in which case it handles
multiple connections).  Its 8 bit clean, not limited to line
mode, is small and light.

If you want access control run it under xinetd, or inetd with tcp
wrappers.  Or you could use the tcp wrapper library to extend it and
do fancy access control - if so please let me know.

redir is released under GPL.

[Original readme from version 0.5]

If you liked daemon, you'll LOVE redir!

Redir, the fully functional (but only in line mode) port redirector for 
unix!  (yeah!  WOOOO!).  Basically, it's like tredir.   But hacked from 
daemon.  And poorly written.   But, hey, it dodges firewalls, and THAT's 
the important part.  I think.  Oh, fuck it.  Look, it's useful.   Good 
for dynamic IP, too.   Trust me, it is.

usage: redir [remote-host] listen_port connect_port

The syntax is a little clumsy, but it works. 

compile with make redir or gcc redir.c -o redir
