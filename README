Redir v.1.1

Redir is a port redirector.  It's functionally basically consists of
the ability to listen for TCP connections on a given port, and, when
it recieves a connection, to then connect to a given destination
address/port, and pass data between them.  It finds most of its
applications in traversing firewalls, but, of course, there are other
uses.  Consult the man page, or run with no options for usage information.

1.1 adds the option --ftp, which, when redirecting a port to an FTP
server, will, when the server wants to initiate a passive connection,
redirect another port for that connection.  

1.0 adds the option --bind-addr, which can force it to bind to a
specific address or interface when making outgoing connections.

I'm thinking of doing a 2.0 which never forks, but does one
big-honking-select-loop, which probably wouldn't be much of a bother,
and would save a good chunk of ram, but then an FD limit becomes quite
a real possibility.  perhaps an #ifdef selecting the old or new code
would help this...  though, really, this is a known problem with a lot
of proxies, and it doesn't seem to hurt too bad.  depends on the
MAX_FDS (or whatever that define is.  FD_MAX?) on your machine.

Wow.  The authorship/maintnence for this thing has REALLY gotten mangled.  
Credits should, logically, go to the following people:

Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@ThePLAnet.net>
	For taking the code I wrote and making it into a more stable 
	sensible, and usable package.  
Sam Creasey <sammy@users.qual.net>
	Original author, but this package would be vastly inferior without 
	Nigel's modifications.
Thomas Osterried <thomas@x-berg.in-berlin.de>
	Added the --bind-addr patch.

Redir v.0.7

redir is a tcp port redirector for unix.
It can run under inetd or stand alone (in which case it handles
multiple connections).  Its 8 bit clean, not limited to line
mode, is small and light.

If you want access control run it under xinetd, or inetd with tcp
wrappers.  Or you could use the tcp wrapper library to extend it and
do fancy access control - if so please let me know.

redir is released under GPL.

[Original readme from version 0.5]

If you liked daemon, you'll LOVE redir!

Redir, the fully functional (but only in line mode) port redirector for 
unix!  (yeah!  WOOOO!).  Basically, it's like tredir.   But hacked from 
daemon.  And poorly written.   But, hey, it dodges firewalls, and THAT's 
the important part.  I think.  Oh, fuck it.  Look, it's useful.   Good 
for dynamic IP, too.   Trust me, it is.

usage: redir [remote-host] listen_port connect_port

The syntax is a little clumsy, but it works. 

compile with make redir or gcc redir.c -o redir
