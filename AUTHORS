Wow.  The authorship/maintnence for this thing has REALLY gotten mangled.
Credits should, logically, go to the following people:

Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@ThePLAnet.net>
	For taking the code I wrote and making it into a more stable
	sensible, and usable package.
Sam Creasey <sammy@oh.verio.com>
	Original author, but this package would be vastly inferior without
	Nigel's modifications.
Thomas Osterried <thomas@x-berg.in-berlin.de>
	Added the --bind-addr patch.
